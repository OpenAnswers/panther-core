Views allow you to limit your console view via a server side query.

### Adding Views

Adding a view requires you to enter a single field name and the value to query for.

Text you enter will default to an exact matching string.

    summary: exact text

You can use /regular expressions/ as well by surrounding your re with forward slash's '/'.

    summary: /some text/

A number 5 will look for a numeric type of data.

    summary: 5

If you want to match a number that is in fact a string, surround the number in double quotes.

    summary: "5"

The view your console defaults to can be set by clicking on the view you would like. Then clicking on the "Default" button.

### Deleting a View

You can delete a view by clicking on the view you would like to delete, then clicking on the red trash icon.
